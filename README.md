# Cloud Models

Cloud models define the deployment type of cloud resources. There are three main cloud models:

## 1. Private Cloud:

- Used by a single entity, offering greater control.
- Evolution from a corporate datacenter.
- Hosted on-site or in a dedicated offsite datacenter.
- Greater cost, fewer benefits of a public cloud.

## 2. Public Cloud:

- Built, controlled, and maintained by a third-party provider.
- Accessible to anyone purchasing cloud services.
- General public availability distinguishes it from private clouds.

## 3. Hybrid Cloud:

- Utilizes both public and private clouds in an interconnected environment.
- Enables private cloud surge for increased, temporary demand using public cloud resources.
- Provides flexibility and an extra layer of security.
- Users choose which services to keep in the public cloud and which to deploy privately.
